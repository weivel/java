 * emitted, and {@link TsModule} renders its members as free functions rather than an interface a
 * caller would otherwise have to cast a module namespace through. manifestSchema returns
 * {@code Object} because a JSON Schema is a recursive blob its callers stringify rather than read
 * field by field, and declaring that recursion would buy no caller anything. pluginError returns
 * {@link PluginErrorShape} rather than a raw {@code Error}, because that is the real shape
 * {@code JsErrors.mint} attaches and a caller can read it with no cast. setDiagnosticSink's sink is a
 * {@link Consumer}, which this processor maps to a function type, so no raw escape remains anywhere
 * in this surface.
